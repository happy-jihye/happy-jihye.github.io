My favorite movie is "Midnight in Paris." This movie was filmed in Paris and contained beautiful background from Paris. I could see the artistic aspect of Paris from the first scene with the Eiffel Tower in Paris to the very end of the movie. After watching the movie, I fell in love with Jazz and dreamed of going to Europe.

I was impressed with the message in this movie. Gil is the main character who constantly admires the past of Paris. Coincidently, Gil travels to the 1920s and meets Adriana, who *adores* the Belle Epoque era. While traveling in the Belle Epoque era, even before the 1920s, Adriana suggests Gil remain in the Belle Epoque, and Gil refused to. He said:

*"I was trying to escape my present the same way you're trying to escape yours, to a golden age.*

*...*

*Adriana, if you stay here, and this becomes your present, then, pretty soon, you'll start imagining another time was your, you know, was the golden time.*

*That's what the present is.*

*That it's a little unsatisfying because life's a little unsatisfying."*

He awoke from an illusion that living in the past makes him happy while looking at people like himself who weren't satisfied with the present. I think that everyone has thought at least once, 'What if we lived in the past than now?' I also wondered that I would have done something more wonderful if I had lived in the past because this is an era that is so advanced. I believe that every period has its romance, which means the present should have romance, too. I hope that everyone including myself can find their romance in the given environment, not just admiring the past.

I wish Gil to be satisfied with choosing the present rather than the 1920s he admired and feel the romance of Paris today.
